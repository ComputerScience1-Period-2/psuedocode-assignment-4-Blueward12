Psueudocode assignment: Blackjack

Shuffle deck of 52 cards;

Pass out one card face down to each player;

Pass out one card face up to each player;

The players look at their cards, making sure that the face down card stays hidden from everyone else's view;

The players add up the total of their cards;

        Number cards are worth face value;
        
        If the card is an Ace:
                Player can decide if it is worth 1 or 11;
                
        Face cards are worth a value of 10;
        
Players determine how close they are to having a combined total of 21;

If the player has a total of 21, the player calls blackjack and flips the card, giving him the win to the game;

If the players decide to Hit:
          The player is given another card face up by asking the dealer;

          The player adds the value of their new card to their total and determines how close they are to a value of 21;
          
          If the player's total exceeds 21:
          A bust is called and that player loses the game
          Other player wins;
          
          If the player's total is equal 21:
          they win the game;
          
          If the player's total is less than 21:
          They decide whether they want to hit again, or Stand;
          
If the player decides to Stand:
         The player locks in and stays with the total value they have;
         The player awaits for the other person's moves;
         
If both players have reached a stand:
Compare their totals;

The player with the higher card value wins the game, without exceeding 21;
         If the players tie:
         the round is a tie and nobody wins or loses;
