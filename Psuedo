Psueudocode assignment: Blackjack

Step 1: Shuffle deck of 52 cards.
Step 2: Pass out one card face down to each player.
Step 3: Pass out one card face up to each player.
Step 4: The players look at their cards, making sure that the face down card stays hidden from anyone else's view.
Step 5: The players add up the total of their cards
        Number cards are worth face value, with the exeption of Ace, with is worth either a value 1 or 11, chosen by the player.
        Face cards are all worth a value of 10. 
Step 6: Players determine how close they are to having a combined total of 21.
Step 7: If the player has a total of 21, the player calls blackjack and flips the card, giving him the win to the game.

Step 8: If the players decide to Hit:
          The player is given another card face up.
          Step 9a: The player adds the value of their new card to their total and determines how close they are to a value of 21.
          Step 10a: If the player's total exceeds 21, a bust is called and that player loses the game, giving the win to the other player.
          Step 11a: If the player's total is equal 21, they win the game.
          Step 12a: If the player's total is less than 21, they decide whether they want to hit again, or Stand.
Step 9: If the player decides to Stand:
         The player locks in and stays with the total value they have.
         Step 10b: The player awaits for the other person's moves.
Step 10: Once both players have reached a stand, their totals are compared.
Step 11: The player with the higher card value wins the game, without exceeding 21.
         If the players tie, the round is a tie and nobody wins or loses.
